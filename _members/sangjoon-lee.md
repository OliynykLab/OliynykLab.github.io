I am a second-year M.S. student in Materials Science and Engineering at Columbia University in the Department of Applied Physics and Applied Mathematics at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Science.

I am interested in computational materials science providing tools and theoretically informed guidance in materials synthesis and analysis. I am actively learning or deploying techniques in first principles, data-driven approaches, and numerical methods in solving materials science problems.

I have a B.E. in Chemical Engineering with minors in Computer Science and Chemistry from The Cooper Union. During my undergraduate studies, I conducted independent research in computational chemistry, where I gained experience in force-field structural optimization, ab initio calculations, and open-source development.
