Hi! I'm a PhD student at CUNY in NYC. My research interests are pretty broad, but revolve around using computational methods to explore novel materials and chemistries coupled with experimental validation, although I'm a bench chemist at heart. In my free time I like baking, making new coffee recipes and powerlifting!
