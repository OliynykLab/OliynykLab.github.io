Hello! I graduated from Hunter College in December 2024 with a B.A. in Human Biology and a minor in Chemistry. As a research volunteer in the Olinynk Lab, I currently work with experimental data to develop computational tools for inorganic labs while building my skills in Python, R, and HTML/CSS. In my free time, I enjoy going on runs, attending trivia nights with friends, and updating my Beli.
