Natalia is an undergraduate student at the Macaulay Honors College at Hunter College pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Chemistry with the goal of becoming a physician after completing medical school. She is now delving into her strong passion for understanding the intricacies of working on intermetallics in the lab, working with novel compounds and their crystal structures. Her current research focuses on novel quaternary compounds RE7M4InGe12, vastly expanding the Yb₇Co₄InGe₁₂ structure-type series originally reported in the tetragonal P4/m space group. In her free time, she enjoys spending time with her family, hiking, and baking.
