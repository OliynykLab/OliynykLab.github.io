Hi!
 
I graduated from Hunter College in December 2024 with a B.A. in Chemistry. Before coming to Hunter, I studied at Moscow State University, where I gained hands-on experience in radiochemistry and materials science.
 
Now my interests are in solid-state chemistry, chemical informatics, and machine learning for materials discovery. I’m especially into designing and synthesizing new compounds (the hotter the furnace, the better) and using tools like XRD and SEM to figure out what we’ve made. I enjoy playing with data just as much as chemicals, building predictive models to better understand and even anticipate crystal structures. I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from tritium-labeled compounds to intermetallics with potential nuclear applications, and I’m always looking for new ways to combine experimental work with computational tools.
 
Outside the lab, I’m usually on a hiking trail, experimenting in the kitchen, or going for a run to clean my head.
