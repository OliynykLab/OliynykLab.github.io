I am a Janovic and Yalow scholar at CUNY-Hunter College double majoring in Biochemistry and Sociology and double minoring in Mathematics and Psychology.

Although my research interests are broad, I enjoy working with novel intermetallics. My current research project involves a novel intermetallic that is a part of the RE10MCd3 (RE = rare-earth, M = transition metal) series.
