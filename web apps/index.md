## Easily Accessible Lab Tools  

For those without any GitHub experience, we've developed our software into easily accessible web applications deployed using Heroku. These tools are designed to simplify data analysis without requiring software installation. Here are some of them:

### {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-flask" %} XRD Pattern Matcher  

**Description:** *Currently in development!* The XRD Pattern Matcher will enable users to compare experimental `.xy` files with `.cif` crystal structure files. This tool aims to assist in phase identification by matching diffraction patterns to known structures, helping streamline material characterization.
