  description: This is a package that can generate custom features, essential for ML, especially for analyzing complex crystal structures like Yb₁₄MnSb₁₁, a thermoelectric material with a Ca₁₄AlSb₁₁-type structure. These features capture detailed geometric and structural information, such as polyhedron volumes, edge distortions, and atomic distances, focusing on specific sites like Mn(8a) and Sb₄(8b). Researchers can better correlate material properties, such as conductivity and band gap, by tailoring features to structural nuances with their crystal environments. This approach is automated for high-throughput analysis, enabling the study of large datasets efficiently.

  link: https://github.com/balaranjan/High-throughput-LMTO
  description: This is a package to automate the steps involved in performing LMTO calculations. The code will take a list of .cif files as input and for each structure in the list, an LMTO calculation will be performed including optimization, band structure calculation, and density of states calculation (DOS). The outputs from band structure and DOS calculation are saved as comma-separated files.
