# The Oliynyk Lab

In our lab, we explore intermetallicsâ€”compounds where metals and metalloids intersect. Our mission? To discover novel compounds, unravel their crystal structures, and see just how far these materials can go. By combining cutting-edge syntheses, characterization, and machine learning, we're pushing the boundaries of materials science, one intermetallic at a time.

## Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research is special in the sense that we do exploratory synthesis, trying to learn about structure-property relationships of various compositions and crystal systems. Many of these properties are valuable, such as superconductivity and neutron absorption therefore can afford benefits to society.

We developed many in-house open-source softwares as well as tutorials for solid state chemists to take advantage of with them in mind.
