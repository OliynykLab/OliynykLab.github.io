We recently had the pleasure of welcoming our volunteer researchers from Bronx Science High School - Yujing, Joseph, and Brandon to the lab. Their visit was filled with curiosity, hands-on learning, and meaningful contributions to our ongoing projects.

During their time with us, the students worked remotely on specific computational tasks, such as implementing PC/PLS-DA for crystal structure classification (Yujing), Pymatgen for polyhedra identification (Brandon), and SISSO for ML techniques (Joseph)!

Here are some highlights from their visit:

We are grateful for the energy and enthusiasm Yujing, Joseph, and Brandon brought to the lab. Their visit was a wonderful reminder of the importance of mentorship and the excitement of scientific exploration. We look forward to seeing all they accomplish in the future!
