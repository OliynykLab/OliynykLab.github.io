subtitle: 
description: In our lab, we explore intermetallicsâ€”compounds where metals and metalloids intersect. Our mission? To discover novel compounds, unravel their crystal structures, and see just how far these materials can go. By combining cutting-edge syntheses, characterization, and machine learning, we're pushing the boundaries of materials science, one intermetallic at a time.
