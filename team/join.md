**Interested in the exciting world of solid-state chemistry?**

Are you passionate about advancing materials chemistry through the integration of computational and experimental methods? Do you thrive in highly collaborative environments, working alongside both experimentalists and computationalists? Are you driven by the challenge of tackling complex problems and making impactful contributions to cutting-edge research?

If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, we would love to consider you for a position in our lab. We are constantly looking for motivated **students**, **developers**, and **interns** to join our team. Our lab is a dynamic, collaborative space where diverse backgrounds and expertise come together to drive meaningful scientific discoveries.

If you’re a **graduate student**, we invite you to apply to the [CUNY Graduate Center's Chemistry PhD program](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/chemistry). We also encourage individuals from diverse educational and career paths to reach out – we value unique perspectives and are open to applicants with varied backgrounds.

**Note**: If you're interested in applying, please take the time to explain why you’re excited about our work and how you believe you could contribute. This helps us understand your motivations and how you can pursue your interests!
